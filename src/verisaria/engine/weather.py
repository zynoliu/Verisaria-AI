"""Weather — a slow, climate-gated random walk over a per-climate condition
ladder, advanced by elapsed in-world time (hourly), deterministically seeded so a
save replays to the same sky.

Kept deliberately small: each climate is an ordered ladder from its mildest to its
roughest condition; weather steps at most one rung per hour (mostly stays put), so
it evolves believably without a full transition matrix. The status bar shows a
single glyph + name; richer atmosphere is the narrator's job.

Pure functions, zero engine deps; see docs/design/worldclock-and-weather.md.
