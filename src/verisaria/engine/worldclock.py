"""World clock — a real in-world time that flows at a *variable* rate per tick.

A tick is a narrative beat, not a fixed duration: a charged exchange is a couple
of minutes, a quiet「等到天亮」fast-forward is hours. The engine already grades
each beat's density via ``PacingSpeed`` (SLOW for conversation/combat, FAST/FORCE
for quiet/crisis), so we hang in-world time off that verdict — minutes-per-step
keyed on the pacing speed — instead of ``tick × constant``.

Pure functions, zero engine deps; see docs/design/worldclock-and-weather.md.
